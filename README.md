MLBFantasyStats
===============

Stats parser for an ESPN Fantasy Baseball League.

Current usage:

gradle oneJar - builds the singular jar file with everything we need.

java -jar build/libs/fbb-scraper-standalone.jar - executes FBBMain. This will start Jetty instead eventually, once we get some Jersey resources written.
